# Protocol for Processing Multivariate Time-series Electronic Health Records of COVID-19 Patients

The lack of standardized techniques for processing complex health data from COVID-19 patients hinders the development of accurate predictive models in healthcare. To address this, we present a protocol for utilizing real-world multivariate time-series electronic health records of COVID-19 patients. We describe steps for covering the necessary setup, data standardization, and formatting. We then provide detailed instructions for creating datasets and for training and evaluating AI models designed to predict two key outcomes: in-hospital mortality and length of stay.

## Requirements

To get started with the repository, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.11+
- PyTorch 2.5+ (use Lightning AI)
- See `requirements.txt` for additional dependencies.

â”œâ”€â”€ standardize_preprocess.py # steps for preparing and preprocess the EHR data
â”œâ”€â”€ further_process.py # steps for further processing the EHR data
â”œâ”€â”€ train_evaluate.py # steps for training and evaluating the AI models
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt # python software packages required for running the code
```

## Usage

The raw data in our research is already in the `datasets/tjh/raw/` folder.

To start with the data processing steps, use the following commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Standardize and preprocess the EHR data
python standardize_preprocess.py

# Step 2: Further process the EHR data
python further_process.py
```

To start with the training and evaluating, use the following command:

```bash
# Step 3: Train and evaluate the AI models
python train_evaluate.py
```

If you want to use datasets from other sources, please download the datasets and put them in the `datasets/` folder. Then, modify the file paths in the `standardize_preprocess.py` and `further_process.py`, and the `dataset` parameter in the `configs/config.py` file.
